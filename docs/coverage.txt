Code coverage files are generated with compiler options in conan/profiles/linux_debug
(test-build-all.cmake script uses this conan profile for Linux Debug build).

How to generate html report to analyze code coverage:
  $ lcov -o coverage.info -c -d $BUILD_DIR --base-directory $SOURCE_DIR --no-external --demangle-cpp --keep-going
            # "--base-directory $SOURCE_DIR --no-external" - exclude external includes
            # "--keep-going" - continue after lcov errors (https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov/issues/238)
  $ genhtml -o coverage --filter brace -no-function-coverage --flat coverage.info
            # "--filter brace" - fix false "no coverage on }" (for example, in string/case_convert.hpp)
            # "--no-function-coverage" - remove false info (CATCH2_INTERNAL_TEMPLATE_TEST_... are always < 100%)
            # "--flat" - show all files on html webpage

Note: previously coverage options were activated in prosoft/core/tests/CMakeLists.txt
also only for Linux Debug build. For details, see commit 01ad3b4 by Brian Bergstrand:
  if (PSGCC)
  # Coverage is not enabled for clang as Xcode 7.2 clang hangs compiling regex_tests.cpp.
  # I'm thinking it has something to do with the .cpp includes.
  set(PSCOVERAGE ${DEBUG})
  endif()
